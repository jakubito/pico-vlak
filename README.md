# PICO VLAK

PICO VLAK is a simple snake clone that served as my introduction project to [PICO-8](https://www.lexaloffle.com/pico-8.php). It is a conversion/reimagination of my favorite childhood game [Vlak](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vlak_(video_game)) by Miroslav Němeček, which came out on PCs in 1993. The core gameplay remains close to the original, while sprites and levels have been redesigned to accomodate lower resolution of PICO-8 screen.
